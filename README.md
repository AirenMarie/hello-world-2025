new practice repo for Code:You

Hello, my name is Airen and this is my second Code:You Web Development cohort.

I signed up for Code:You because I want to learn new skills that will help me to secure a new career in the tech field which will provide stability, flexibility, and a better quality of life. At the very least, I hope to bring more skills to my current job for a better position where I can work comfortably until retirement.

After working more than 24 years for the same company, I'm ready to move forward into a new chapter in my life.
